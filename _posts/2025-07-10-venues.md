## Overview

The following tables lists the conference and journal venues that we (Greg and his students) typically target for publishing our research (assuming a focus on software testing). Other venues may be considered, depending on the topic and maturity level of the work. However, these represent our "typical" targets, and are also good venues to look at when searching for related work.
