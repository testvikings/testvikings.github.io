<h4><strong>Lirong (Esme) Yi</strong></h4> 

I am a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, researching software optimization and code generation using large language models. My work is supervised by Philipp Leitner and Gregory Gay.

Before joining Chalmers, I worked as a Compiler Engineer at IBM, contributing to the LLVM project. I hold both a bachelor's and a master's degree in Software Engineering from Donghua University.
