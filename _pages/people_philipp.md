<h4><strong>Philipp Leitner</strong></h4> 

I am an Associate Professor of Software Engineering at Chalmers, a private research university in Gothenburg, Sweden. I currently manage the Software Engineering 2 unit, with approximately 25 faculty and doctoral students. My current research interests are centered around measuring, predicting, and improving the performance of software systems, especially (but not only) in a cloud computing context.

I also lead the Internet Computing and Emerging Technologies Lab (ICET-lab), a research group focussing on various aspects of Internet and cloud computing. I have published some 150 peer-reviewed publications on performance engineering, (micro-) services, cloud systems, and empirical software engineering, leading to an h-index of 45 as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wZ9f8CAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tracked by Google Scholar</a>. I am commonly publishing at and reviewing for top conferences and journals in the field, including ICSE, FSE, TSE, and EMSE.
